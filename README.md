# Frontend Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the Frontend locally using Yarn.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- Yarn package manager

## Local Development

### Install Dependencies

First, install all necessary dependencies for the project. Open your terminal and run the following command in the root directory of your project:

bash

> Copy code

    yarn install

> Copy code

    yarn dev

### Setup Environment Variables

Setting up environment variables is crucial for managing settings and configurations that should not be hardcoded in your source code, such as URLs, etc. Hereâ€™s how to set them up:

1. **Duplicate the example environment file**: Start by duplicating the `.env.example` file in your project directory. This file usually contains all the necessary environment variables with placeholder values or comments on what each variable is used for. In your terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names the copy `.env`, which will be your active environment file.

2. **Edit the `.env` file**: Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor. Replace the placeholder values with your specific configurations. For instance:

    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=your_backend_api`

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the dependencies listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.
